                    <p>We are surrounded by technology and it involves all aspects of our lives. Along the last decades big efforts have been put to create lighter, faster, more reliable and safer systems. Following the Mooreâ€™s law we can in fact now use devices which double their performance every 18 months. Even though we often do not perceive any improvement in terms of user experience so that our job does not really seem easier compared to the one of few years ago.</p>
                    <p>We are supposed to live in a better world, a world improved by technology, where the heating can set up itself getting meteorological information from the Internet or through sensors placed outside and our cars are so intelligent that they could be soon drive us home safety. Still we often go back to a freezing house and we almost cause accidents trying to set the navigation system of our car using vocal instructions.</p>
                    <p>The reason is often no attention has paid to the usability aspects of the system: while it is considered normal for programmers to know every important technical detail, such as how the memory is handled by the operating system in order to write an efficient code, it is not required to them to have any knowledge at all about how the system should be developed in terms of usability.</p>
                    <p>After briefly discussing why human computer interaction is underrated today and explaining why this trend is so dangerous, it will be presented and discussed the keys concepts of the human cognitive psychology which are strongly relevant in the HCI studies: knowing how the user works is crucial to help whoever is developing a system to derive useful guidelines which can be successfull applied for the development of well-designed systems. Finally a practical example is shown: principles and guidelines explained in the first part are used to evaluate two pages of the Swansea University Website.</p>
