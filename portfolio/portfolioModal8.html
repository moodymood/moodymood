                    <p>Finally the time of my fist coursework submission came. I was at the library and I had just finished working on my essay so that I had to print it out. After briefly looking for information on the university website I discovered that I could print the essay through website itself: “perfect!”. I logged-in into the system, uploaded the file, pressed the ‘Mono’ option to print in black and white and “horror!”: with a mixture of disappointing and fear, with no chance to undo my action, a message appeared in front of my eyes: “Your print job has been sent to the selected printer successfully” with the printing status set to “Printing”. I did not want to print it yet, and what “selected machine” was it talking about? I did not choose any. The main reason for my fear was that I had recently attended the university unfair practice lecture, where I learned that my career would have been over if I had been found guilty of plagiarism; now thinking of my essay printed somewhere outside in thrall of any student was driving me crazy. What happened was that I did not expect the printing to be done without any confirmation, or even without choosing the printer machine to use. Not knowing what else to do, I run to the nearest photocopy machines, but my essay was not there. I went back to my laptop, and now on the web-page the printing status was changed to “Printed”. I run back to the photocopy machines again, but still nothing. At this point, I panicked: I really could not understand what was going wrong and “I am a computer scientist!” I kept saying myself. Only after a while, when I succeeded to calm down, I started looking for some instruction on the website to finally realize that “Printed” only meant that the file was sent to the printer, and that a confirmation from the printer itself was still needed to actually print the file. </p>

                    The printing system of the Swansea University is used by hundreds of students everyday and they should not really find themselves facing this kind of situation. Even if it is true that an explanation of the system was given in the website, students should be able to use a printing system easily or at least only by learning while interacting with the system, without spending valuable time reading a manual for such an easy task.</p>
