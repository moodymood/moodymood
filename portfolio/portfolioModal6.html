                    <p>The interest towards the use of technological tools in museums to create a more enjoyable and satisfying user experience and to support the learning process has been increasing in the recent years.</p>
                    <p>In this paper it is presented a qualitative study which consists of two interviews performed on
                    2 museum visitors and 3 museum volunteers who work as guide at the Egypt centre in Swansea. Purpose of interviews is gathering information about the limitations of the current offered tools and exploring new possibilities offered by the adoption of new mobile technologies.</p>

                    <h3>A Qualitative study.</h3>
                        
                    <p>"When going to a museum, most people only see a building with art, however, most museums are far more than that." is the opening quote of a promotional video which presents iBeacon, a technology introduced by Apple to support location awareness in museums. The cited quote perfectly summarizeone of the main problem with museum exhibitions nowadays: the way people are allowed to visit museums is usually strictly passive, the information is usually not personalized according to their preferences and knowledge, so that the learning process is not  is poor and not as much enjoyable as it could be if supported by different tools. We are living in the digital era but people still visit museum relaying on books, written instructions or audio-guide.
                    However, before implementing any new technology or developing any new supporting tool, we need to deeply understand what are the limits of the current ones and how the digital ones could feel the gap of the user needs. Aim of this paper is therefore investigating on these aspects by performing a set of interview involving visitors and volu</p>

                    <h4>Research Questions.</h4>
                        
                    <p>When visiting an exhibition people can usually choose between several options to support their visit, such as tour guides, audio guides, books, or the written instructions spread along the museum. These tools are characterized by several limitations. </p>
                    <p>Firstly, all of them are shaped around a fixed depth of knowledge, meaning that the offered information could be too specific and detailed for a novice visitor or too superficial for an expert one. In theory, the tour guide is the most flexible one, since the guide has got a margin to choose what to tell to visitors according to their curiosity and background; however this theoretical possibility is impeded by the fact that tour guides involve groups of people, so that the guide has to keep in consideration the needs of the group and not of the single.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, except for books, all the offered information are strictly confined inside the museum walls: once the visitor walks out he can no longer access it, even if he paid for it.</p> 
                    <p>Thirdly, the current tools are usually not flexible or easy to change to in terms of order: supposing the visitor is using a book, then he needs to follow the order presented by the book to visit the exhibition or he has to look for the right page every time he wants to know something about a specific artefact; or, even worse, in the case of the tour guide he has got no choice at all, since he has to follow the group.</p>
                    <p>All these considerations lead to my research question:</p>
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>RQ</dt>
                        <dd><p>How can new mobile technologies transform the visitor from a passive observer to an active player?</p> </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Which can be decomposed as:</p>
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>RQ1</dt>
                        <dd><p>How can new mobile technologies be used to support the visitor learning processes? </p></dd>
                        <dt>RQ2</dt>
                        <dd><p>How can new mobile technologies be used to achieve personalization of content, interaction and flexibility?</p></dd>
                        <dt>RQ3</dt>
                        <dd><p>How can new mobile technologies be used to to offer visitors with a more enjoyable, satisfying and unique user experience?</p></dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>To answer these questions we need to involve the main actors: visitors. It is by investigating with them about what make them unhappy about the current tools that we can better understand how those limitations can be overtaken. Museum volunteers are also a vital source of information since, spending their working time at the museum, supporting and helping visitors, they hold a deep awareness about visitor needs.</p>

                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Data Gathering Format.</h4>
                        
                    <p>To gain information from visitors and volunteers a set of semi-structured interviews was chosen. In theory, since the aim of the research is exploratory and the main point is looking for new ideas and insights by engaging constructive discussions, a focus group would have been probably the best choice. However it collides with the actual constraints: visitors are rewarded with anything more than a small refreshment, which would not justify the required effort to take part in a focus group; on the other hand volunteers are involved in the study during their working time, so that bringing back all together at the same time, would leave the museum uncovered of personal. </p>
                    <p>Similarly, an unstructured interview would probably has been more suitable for the purpose, that is stimulating people imagination, raising doubts and brain storming ideas without the weight of any prefixed path to follow. The choice of the semi-structured interview is however justified by the fact that the unstructured interview would requires a great level of expertise from the interviewers, since it is more difficult keep the discussion on the right track and the interpretation is much more challenging \cite{lazar2010research}, while the current interviewer is a non native speaker at her first interviewing experience.</p>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Participants.</h4>
                        
                    <p>Interviews will involve museum visitors, as they are the main actor of the research, and volunteer working as museum guides, because of their knowledge about visitor needs. In particular two male students between 20 and 25 years old and 3 male volunteers between 20 and 45 years old were recruited for the interview. Visitors were recruited on the way out from the museum, once they had finished the exhibition's visit, during weekends, according to the higher affluence, while volunteers were interviewed during  weekdays, in order not to interfere with their main duties.</p>
                        
                    <p class="text-right"><i class="fa fa-paperclip" aria-hidden="true"></i> <small><a target="_blank" href="pdf/portfolio/MobileTechInMuseums_interview-volunteer.pdf"> Volunteer <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="pdf/portfolio/MobileTechInMuseums_interview-visitor.pdf"> Visitor Interview Sheet <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> </a></small></p>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Interview Structure.</h4>
                        
                    <p>The visitor's interview was slightly different from the volunteer one, but they both aimed to gather information towards visitors' needs and they were both constructed around the same main topics. The first part of the interview consisted in a warm up series of non-threatening questions such as demographic close questions. The central part of the interview was the most important and it was shaped towards three main topics: visitors' motivation in visiting museum, visitor opinions about the use of traditional supporting tools and visitor ideas, insights and concerns about how new mobile technologies could be used to integrate or substitute the existing tools.  Finally, the last part of the interview was developed to give a chance to the interviewed to discuss any untreated related topic of his preference and to dissolve any doubts asking questions to the interviewer.</p>
                    <p>The only difference between the visitor and the volunteer interview was the different perspective: while the visitor was asked for answers regarding his opinion, the volunteer was asked to infer the visitor opinion by using his developed knowledge about the visitor's behaviour. In other words, while the visitor's interview gave a direct feedback, the volunteer's interview gave a indirect feedback mediated by his opinion and experience.</p>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Recording Tools.</h4>
                        
                    <p>For the purpose of the study the interviewer used an Android mobile phone, which was used to record the entire interview, and a a laptop, where the audio-recorded files are copied as backup as soon as the interview was completed. The interviewer also disposed of a paper sheets with interview's questions used also to take extra annotation, such as non-verbal communication details.</p>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Procedure.</h4>
                        
                    <p>Visitors were interviewed during weekends because of the higher affluence, and they were recruited on the way out from the museum, once their visit was finished, while volunteers were instead interviewed in their spare during weekdays according to the lower visitors affluence. During the recruitment phase the interviewer introduced herself and she explained the study's motivation and what the study consisted of.</p>
                    <p>Once that the participant accepted to take part on the study, the procedure was slightly different for visitors and volunteers: the visitor was taken to a more private and quiet space just outside the museum area, where a desk with all the required tools (ethics papers, mobile phone for the audio-recording, laptop, interview paper sheets, pens) was set; instead, because volunteers usually sit behind desks in different areas of the museum, and they had to be available for any visitor request, it was up the interviewer to move the required instruments in a suitable place for the volunteer. </p>
                    <p>Before starting the interview, the interviewer delivered the participant the ethic papers (Bill of Rights and Research Consent Form) to be read and signed, reassuring him about any ethical issue and clarifying any doubt that may have been arisen; the interviewer also reminded the participant that the interview was going to be recorded. This phase was identical for each participant.</p>
                    <p>The interview started with a warm-up session where the participant was asked with simple and mainly close questions, to control the level of stress and make the atmosphere serene. After the warm-up session, the main session, where the main topics of the interview are discussed, took place; the order of the questions and the time dedicated to each question was variable, depending on the course of the conversation and what seemed more natural. When the interviewer realized the time was running out (interview time was fixed between 10 to 15 minutes for each participant) or all questions were answered, she started a cool-off period consisting of few easy questions to help the participant to release any tension. Finally, in the closing session, the interviewer switched of the recorder to highlight that the interview was over and she thanked the participant offering him a small refreshment.</p>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h4>Results and Analysis.</h4>
                        
                    <p>Overall the three interviews involved five people divided as following: a group interview with two volunteers, a group interview with two visitors and a single interview with one volunteer. The total time of recording was about one hour and a half. </p>
                    <p>The gathered data have been analysed with a inductive thematic analysis approach, meaning that the coding process did not try to fit the data into a pre-existing model. In other words the used approach was exploratory and content-driven rather than confirmatory and hypothesis-driven: in fact purpose of the research was eliciting new findings from participants without following any prefixed theory. From an initial count of about forty different codes, data have been reduced and grouped into five main themes presented in the following sections.</p>
                        
                        
                    <div class="row">

                        </div>

                    <h5>Visitor's motivation as key to understand their needs.</h5>
                        
                    <p>People visit museums for different reasons, and their motivation is usually strictly connected with their previous knowledge, their expectations and to time and effort they will to spend visiting a museum. From the gathered data emerged that motivations can be very heterogeneous. \\
                    Some people visit museums, even if not directly interested, just to spend their time during a break in an alternative way, or because they deem it as a fascinating place to meet up with friends:</p>
                    <blockquote> It (museum) is a great place to meet up, it's fascinating, you can discover stuff [Visitor].</blockquote> 
                    <p>Other visitors motivations:</p>
                    <blockquote>Why do I visit museums? Well, it's normally raining! [Visitor]</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Most of them (activities) are set for children, to give parents a break giving them something to do [Voluteer]</blockquote>
                    <p>These people usually have a low knowledge about the exhibition they are going to visit, they do not will to spent too much time or effort, since the exhibition is not their primary reason for visiting the museum.</p>
                    <p>Other people, however, can be highly motivated and interested on a specific museum or exhibition: students working on a research project, adults with a passion on a specific topic, they all visit a museum with a certain goal in their mind, which usually is to improve their knowledge on a certain field acquiring as much information as possible. Their motivation is so high that in some cases, how it happens for students involved in some research projects, they even became volunteer in the museum to have an easier access to museum's resources.</p>
                    <p>Finally, for some people the motivation is not visiting a museum or a exhibition itself as a whole, as they are interested in a single, special artefact or activity: </p>
                    \begin{quote}
                    \textit{
                    <blockquote> I can't stress enough how much important is the mummy here (ndr. the mummification activity is the most famous activity at the Egypt centre museum), I can say 80\% of the people they ask for the mummy. It's what everybody wants and what everybody remembers among of the things available [Volunteer].</blockquote>
                    <p>This kind of motivation can be pretty high insomuch as some people even return more than once ,accompanied by friends or family, only because they want to show them what they have  already seen.</p>
                    
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h5>Time and space affecting on visitor' experience.</h5>
                        
                    <p>Time and space are key aspects in the sense they affect on the visitor's experience in several ways.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, museums have opening times, which usually correspond to working time for most of the regular workers, making impossible for them to visit museums during weekdays. This aspect could justified our findings, which reported that weekends' visitors usually consist in schools while weekdays' visitors mainly consist on families and group of adults.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, as mentioned, the visitor's motivation is strictly connected to the time he will to spend to visit a museum which in turns depends on the size and complexity of the exhibition: for example both visitors declared they would will to spend a maximum of three hours for visiting a museum, but on the other hand they also complained because of the lack of time when visiting huge</p>
                    <blockquote>For example with the British museum was absolute massive so there is not time to visit it in only one single visit [Visitor]</blockquote>
                    <p>Space and time limit the user experience in the sense that museums are not always opened, therefore accessible, or they can be too big to be visited given the available amount of time. 
                    On the contrary, space, can also be not enough: a volunteer of the Egypt centre, for example, explained that on the basement of the museum they shielded many artefacts which due to logistic and space reasons, could not be shown to the public.<p>
                    <p>Finally space cannot be enough also because of overcrowding which does not allow people to get access to some part of the exhibition or to take part to the arranged activities:</p>
                    <blockquote>Sometimes it gets very crowed we can't do some of the activities we'd want (..) So if schools are here we let them handle objects but sometimes if someone else wants to handle them but because there is a school here we have to apologise and ask to come back later when they (schools) have lunch [Volunteer].</blockquote>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h5>Visitor preferences for supporting tools.</h5>
                        
                    <p>People approaches for visiting a museum can variate, due to some of the mentioned aspects such as motivation, time and space constraints. The different approach adopted by each person is translated in different preferences for supporting tools. In general, both visitors and volunteers confirmed that people do not like paper books and it is interesting to be noted that, while visitors did not give an explanation for that, volunteers affirmed that people seemed to be afraid by books and reluctant to touch them:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-3: Sometimes they (visitors) use books, but sometimes they rather ask us more or less. Because I think they are really afraid to touch a lot of it. I don't know why people are afraid to touch</blockquote>
                    <p>Audio-guide were judged by the two visitors as interesting but not flexible enough, and in particular one visitor pointed out that sometime they are too expensive or not available:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vi-1: Audio guides just go too slow, or also are unavailable, so reading text was the fasted way to get the knowledge I wanted.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Vi-2: Yeah I always read written instruction it's much more easier</blockquote>
                    <p>Visitors and volunteers disagreed on the visitor's preferred method to gain information: while both visitors declared to prefer written instruction, volunteers saw themselves as the preferred method:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-1: Visitors use different methods but often it's more the case they ask us about something if they need.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Vo-3: They use the books sometimes, or read written instructions, but in general they rather ask us more or less}</blockquote>
                    <p>On this point it must be underlined that because of the low number of people involved is not possible to make any clear assumption, but it is still interesting to note the diversity in perception. Visitors declared to prefer written instruction because considered as an independent way to visit the museum, while volunteers declared thmselves to be the best way to give information because of their flexibility and helpful nature. 
                    Moreover visitors declared that sometimes volunteers were lack in knowledge, fact perhaps confirmed by a volunteer himself:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-1: Sometimes we (volunteers) don't know what they (visitors) want to know but we always say: we may do not have the answer to this question but definitively I can find someone who do have it (...) Because believe me sometimes we have people here who knows enough. But actually they are able to help me. A lot of students who comes here they are learning about Egypt so they are more knowledge about Egypt than I am.</blockquote>
                    <p>so that they usually prefer to look for answer, if needed, using other resources, such as their phones.</p>
                    <p>In particular, visitors seemed to use their own equipment, such as phone or tablet, to look for more detailed information, not provided by the museum, or just to take pictures. In one occasion a visitor pointed out that when he needed visual information, such as maps to contextualise for example a historical event in a certain area, using a mobile phone and visualise the map, rather than asking a volunteer, felt appropriate and effective:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vi-1: I prefer using my phone rather than ask someone, especially if it is visual information such as a map, the visual information helps you to explore information a bit more rather than image if the volunteer answers "it is near Cairo"</blockquote>
                        
                    <br/>
                        
                    <h5>Artefacts fragility and impossible interaction.</h5>
                        
                    <p>Museum are usually characterised by the fact they contain valuable and fragile pieces of art. It means that the user experience and in particular the interaction is seriously compromised. People usually have to look at artefacts positioned in a fixed position, they cannot directly interact or they need to ask to staff members, which are not always available; in the most extreme case they cannot even take photos or talk aloud. Therefore a very challenging task on the museum side, is to find a way to protect the artefact without compromising the user experience by denying the visitor with any interaction:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vi-1: It would be nice if we could show what else we've got in the museum, like we have a store room downstairs and half of the artefacts are unseen because some of them are so fragile that we haven't still found the right way to arrange them in the museum</blockquote>
                    <p>Museum holds precious and unique pieces which is impossible to find in other places, insomuch as some students even decide to became volunteers only to gain free access to the museum resources:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-3: Some students become part of the centre so that they can learn more and have access to the reference we have got and which are not always available.

                    <h5>Respect of visitor emotions and feelings.</h5>
                    
                    <p>Visitor emotions and feelings should be considered carefully and they came up in several critical aspects. One volunteer for example described as one of the most critical task trying to understand the visitor level of knowledge needed: some people just go through a quick visit and they do not want to be engaged in any activity, or they just prefer to visit the museum autonomously, while others ask of all the help they can have:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-1: One of the must challenging aspect is trying to gage how much they know so I can figure out how much information I should give them. Because some people they just come and they don't want to be bother, they just look around and then, maybe, if they want, they stop to ask us something (...) Some people they ask us half dozen of questions for like half an hour before they leave the gallery</blockquote>
                    <p>This aspect is empathised during interactive activities: while children seem usually happy to play, adults are sometimes reticent because they feel patronised if the activity in which they are involved is not challenging enough. A volunteer for example explained that while adults do not usually like the mummification activity, since considered to childish, they all like group table games because considered more challenging:</p>
                    <blockquote>Vo-2: But we also have a games upstairs like table games and they (visitors) all love it, children and adults. Probably because there are very difficult rules, they (adults) don't feel patronised there. Because it's a game, they don't feel like it's not for them. They are intrigued</blockquote>
                    <p>Finally, another critical aspect, concern with the visitor's sensibility and beliefs: some children for example got scared when assisting to the mummification process because afraid that a real dead people was covered underneath the bandages. Moreover some adults, especially if accompanied with children, in many occasions were annoyed by the fact that the volunteer's explanation could be in contrast with their religion beliefs.</p>

                    <h4>Design Implication.</h4> 
                        
                    <p>The gathered data allowed to retrieve the presented five main themes. However these themes are still not directly connected to the research questions introduced at the beginning of the paper. To draw a connection and to try to answer those questions a series of guidelines have been developed: therefore applying the following rules to the development process of any technological system should help for providing visitors with a better user experience.</p>
                        
                    <br>
                    
                    <h5>Flexibility as keyword to model an adequate user experience.</h5>
                        
                    <p>During the research has emerged that people visit museum pushed by a lot of different reasons, so that they can be lowly or highly motivated. Moreover, because the research sample was very limited, it was not possible to investigate all possible reasons so that only a small amount has been considered. 
                    <br/>
                    Referring to the visitor motivation, one of the main challenge that a museum has to face, is to find the right way to shape a user experience which can suit anybody, no matter the time they will to spend for a visit, their interest on the subject or their previous knowledge. Offering flexibility means that people should be able to choose the method they prefer to gain information, but also that that method should be calibrated on their knowledge, expectations, motivations and needs. A good example on this direction was offered by the cited CHESS application\cite{katifori2014chess} which modelled the offered experience by questioning the user with a on-line quiz to perform in advance.</p>
                    <p>Moreover the information should also be given through different parading of interaction, or between the same paradigm but with different approaches: for example an application developed for a mobile phone with a touch screen display could be able to provide the same information using plain text, video, audio, the conjunction of the three of them, or using more creative ways such an interactive games which allow visotors to learn by playing.</p>
                    <p>The presented information should not be bind to a specific amount of time, and the user should be set free to choose and informed about timing. For example when presenting information about a specific area of a museum an application could ask the visitor how much time he will to spend to visit it, offering personalised paths. In this case it is also important to make clear to the user the status of the current activity, that is for example how much of the activity has been already accomplished and how much time is still needed in order to complete it.</p>
                    <p>Those concepts are not new, and they can be for example easily reconduced to the  \textit{User control and freedom} and \textit{Visibility of system} heuristics of Jacob Nielsen\cite{nielsen2005ten}</p>

                    <h5>Overtake space and time limitations: extend user experience outside the museum's physical borders.</h5>
                        
                    <p>We have seen that space and time are one of the biggest limitation of visitors, in the sense they cannot always get access to museums because of the opening times, they cannot participate to some activities if they require too long or if the place is too crowed so that only a restrict amount of people can participate. Time and space constraints can be easily overtaken with the use of technology.</p>

                    </dl>  
                        
                    <p>For example we could develop an application to inform the user about the artefact shown in a certain area not accessible at the moment because too crowed. The visitor would be able to decide if he is interested, so that he would wait, maybe reading some information about the artefact in the meanwhile, or to proceed towards other areas of the museums. Even better the application could allow the visitor to take note of unavailable artefacts on a virtual map so that he could have reference points to go back to in a second moment.</p>
                    <p>The mobile application could also allow to scan and recognise artefacts, storing them in a virtual personal gallery which can be accessed by the user whenever he wants and even outside the museum. The application would allow the visitor to preserve his experience outside any limitation of time and space making his experience pervasive since any border would disappear.</p>

                    <p>In figure is presented  a possible implementation for an application: basic functionality would allow the visitor to some artefact to a list, collect photos, collect information, see the availability of the artefact, indicated with a red/green led. To engage a long-lasting relationship some of the item could be made unreachable outside the museum, such as the fourth which is displayed on a grey colour. In fact as pointed out by Barnes\cite{barnes2011museum}, making all the content available to everyone even outside the museum could cause a lack of surprise in audiences: then the fact that some content is available only inside would create a stronger relationship between the visitor and the museum.</p>
                        
                    <br>
                    
                    <h5>Substitute an impossible real interaction with a possible virtual interaction</h5>
                        
                    <p>We have seen that, except for time and space, that last big constraint is represented by the the value, uniqueness and the fragility of the artefacts. It means that the visitor interaction is inherently limited by the fact that artefacts cannot usually be touched, or even completely seen since most of the time they are shielded behind glasses in a fixed position. One more time technology can easily permit to overtake the limitation. </p>

                    </dl>   
                        
                    <p>We could imagine for example to develop an application which show a 3d model of the artefact  which can be therefore easily manipulated, or we could use the virtual reality to simulate and achieve an immersive user experience. A good example, even if not related with a mobile technology, is given by the \textit{Mummy explorer project} \footnote{\url{http://www.interspectral.com/projects/mummy-explorer/}.} which allows visitors to be able to use simple multi-touch gestures to explore a mummy as shown in figure~\ref{fig:mockup3}.</p>
                            
                    <br>
                    
                    <h5>Understand and respect user feelings.</h5>
                        
                    <p>When engaging an interaction with visitors we should always consider their feeling and be careful toward any critical aspect. For example if we are developing a game which contains scenes that could scare a child or a sensitive adult, we should make sure to implement some mechanism to inform the user and prevent the children to use it without the parents' consent. We should also always be careful not to offend visitor beliefs when the presented content could be in contrast with religion or political beliefs.</p>
                    <p>The task of understanding visitors is not obviously accomplished only by thinking of methods to avoid bad feelings, and it needs to focus on finding ways to promote the positive ones. For example during the study is emerged that visitors, especially if adults, have the need to be involved in activities which are perceived as challenging, otherwise there is a risk that they will feel patronised. Offering challenging activities can be achieved is a similar way to the one presented in the \textit{Flexibility as keyword to model an adequate user experience} section where to offer a different depth of information, different levels of information were offered to the visitor.</p>

                    <p>In this paper are presented results of a qualitative study, conducted on 5 people through an unstructured interview, on how mobile technology can be used to improve the visitor experience.</p>
                    <p>The gathered data allowed to distinguish five main themes: visitors are pushed by different motivations, so that they have different needs in terms of required information, time and effort they will to spend for a visit; the visitors experience is usually limited by time and space constraints which do not allow him to be in control of his own interaction; the visitor experience is also limited by the intrinsic nature of the museum as shield of valuable and untouchable artefacts; visitors, according to several aspects, need and prefer different tools for supporting their visit; finally, the visitor experience can be seriously compromised if their feelings are not taken into account in each interaction step.</p>
                    <p>Findings allowed to derive some guidelines that should be applied for the development of any technology which may be involved in museum exhibition, and for the implementation of any system using the current technology. The presented guidelines are defined by a general character, so that some practical implementation examples, to confer a more practical approach, have been provided.</p>
                    <p>In particular the following guidelines have been suggested: <i>flexibility as keyword to model an adequate user experience</i>, <i>overtake space and time limitations: extend user experience outside the museum's physical borders</i>, <i>substitute an impossible real interaction with a possible virtual interaction</i> and finally <i>understand and respect user feelings</i></p>
                    <p>Despite the study allowed to discover some interesting findings, because of the lack of skills of the researcher as interviewer, the result quality could have been slightly compromised. The study still represent a good starting point from an exploratory point of you, but for any further study it is recommended to pursue on a more specific and focused area of interest.</p>
